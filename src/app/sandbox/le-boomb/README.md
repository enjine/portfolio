# WhammyKablammy v1.0.0 (adapted from "Le Boomb" by [Henri Jean Vanaise](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/488/h-jean-vanaise))

## Rules
- The bomb starts in the center of the gameboard
- The die starts with the oldest player
- The die is always passed to the left
- The die has sides labeled fuse, bomb, boom
- A player's turn is over after they pass the die
- A player is out of the game if the bomb explodes while they're holding it
- The last remaining player is the winner

## Rolling the die
- a player's turn includes 1 roll of the dice and ends when they pass the dice
- roll a fuse and the bomb stays in front of you. your turn ends.
- 3 fuses in a row => bomb explodes
- roll a bomb and the bomb comes to you
	- if you're holding the bomb, pass it to any player and end your turn.
- roll a boom
  - if you're holding the bomb, you ded. you're out the game.
    - if you're out, you do not have to leave the party
