We had a robust CI pipeline and a formal change management process for releases that I helped to coordinate across all engineering teams. Shortly before my contract expired, I was asked to join as an FTE and take on the responsibilities of Tech Lead. I agreed, and in time was asked to fulfill additional roles as needed. I consulted across teams when technical expertise, rapid prototyping, or domain knowledge was needed and acted as interim Engineering Manager in absence of the role being filled. During my time here I was able to continue my passion for frontend work and creating great user experiences, but I was also given the opportunity to exercise my leadership skills in a formal management role.'
