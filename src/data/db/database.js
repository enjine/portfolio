My technical contributions were predominantly full-stack front-end on top of a SOA backend. We had a robust CI pipeline and a formal change management process for releases that I helped to coordinate across all engineering teams. Shortly before my contract expired, I was asked to join as an FTE and take on the responsibilities of Tech Lead. I agreed, and in time was asked to fulfill additional roles as needed. I consulted across teams when technical expertise, rapid prototyping, or domain knowledge was needed and acted as interim Engineering Manager in absence of the role being filled. During my time here I was able to continue my passion for frontend work and creating great user experiences, but I was also given the opportunity to exercise my leadership skills in a formal management role.'

Clients included David himself, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Madonna, Mariah Carey, The Police, AC/DC and many others. My adept handling of those responsibilities allowed me to rapidly evolve into more of a player/coach as the team grew to 5+ designers and developers. I was responsible for ensuring our team delivered all client work as well as prototyping and pitching new features to prospective clients. Out of necessity, I invented my own processes, workflows and libraries to organize work for the company, set expectations with client managers, and provide engineers a high level of reusability and extensibility across projects. I also organized and executed exclusive members-only experiences, live chats and webcasts from venues.'
